## 📘 Overview

This repository contains all labs and project work completed for CPS510, focusing on the principles and engineering practices of database system design. The course emphasizes:

- Relational database modeling and normalization (1NF–BCNF)  
- SQL queries, constraints, and relational algebra  
- Physical database structures and indexing  
- Application-level database integration  
- Hierarchical, network, and inverted file models  

Through hands-on assignments, we designed, implemented, and tested scalable and efficient database systems, including a full Payroll Management System.
